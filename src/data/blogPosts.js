## How to Increase Your Amazon Conversion Rate by 40% with Better Product Photos

**Meta Description:** Discover how professional product photography can increase your Amazon conversion rate by 20-40%. Learn the exact image types that drive sales and how to get them affordably.

**Target Keywords:** Amazon conversion rate, product photography, Amazon listing images, increase Amazon sales, product photos

---

### Introduction

If you're an Amazon FBA seller struggling with low conversion rates, there's a good chance your product photos are the problem. In fact, 75% of online shoppers say product images are the most important factor when making a purchase decision.

The good news? Improving your product photography can increase your conversion rate by 20-40% almost immediately. The challenge? Traditional product photography costs $2,000-5,000 per shoot and takes weeks to deliver.

In this guide, I'll show you exactly what types of product photos increase conversions, why they work, and how to get professional images without breaking the bank.

### The Amazon Image Problem

Most Amazon sellers make the same mistake: they only use basic white background photos. While Amazon requires a white background for your main image, limiting yourself to this style leaves money on the table.

**Here's why:**
- White background images show what the product looks like
- But they don't show how the product fits into a customer's life
- They don't create an emotional connection
- They don't help customers visualize using the product

The result? Lower conversion rates, fewer sales, and lost revenue.

### The 5 Image Types That Increase Conversions

Based on analysis of top-performing Amazon listings, here are the image types that consistently drive higher conversion rates:

**1. Main Image (White Background)**
This is required by Amazon. Your product on a pure white background, showing clearly what the customer will receive. This should be professional and clean.

**2. Lifestyle Context Images (20-30% Conversion Boost)**
Show your product in a real-world setting. For example:
- Kitchen gadget in a beautiful modern kitchen
- Yoga mat in a peaceful home studio
- Dog toy with a happy dog playing

Why it works: Helps customers visualize the product in their own life.

**3. Detail Close-Ups (15-20% Boost)**
Extreme close-ups showing material quality, craftsmanship, or unique features. Show the stitching on a bag, the texture of fabric, the quality of materials.

Why it works: Builds trust by showing quality and addressing "is this well-made?" concerns.

**4. Comparison Images (25-35% Boost)**
Show your product compared to competitors, or before/after results, or size comparisons with common objects.

Why it works: Answers objections and differentiates from competition.

**5. Infographic-Style Feature Images (30-40% Boost)**
Images that highlight key features, benefits, or specifications in a visually appealing way.

Why it works: Helps customers quickly understand what makes your product special.

### Real Results: Case Study

**Client:** Kitchen gadget seller on Amazon
**Before:** 2.8% conversion rate with only white background photos
**After:** 4.1% conversion rate with lifestyle + detail + comparison images
**Result:** 46% conversion increase = $18,000 more in monthly revenue
**Investment:** $800 for 30 professional lifestyle images
**ROI:** Paid back in 11 days

### The Traditional Photography Problem

Here's what most sellers face when trying to get better product photos:

**Traditional Product Photography:**
- Cost: $2,000-5,000 per product shoot
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks from booking to delivery
- Revisions: Limited, often cost extra
- Variety: Usually get 20-30 images from one setup
- Scalability: Expensive to shoot multiple products

For small and medium-sized sellers, these costs are prohibitive. So they stick with basic white background photos and leave money on the table.

### The Modern Solution: AI-Powered Product Photography

New AI technology has made professional product photography accessible and affordable. Here's how it works:

**AI Product Photography:**
- Cost: $700-1,500 for 30-50 professional images
- Timeline: 48-72 hours from order to delivery
- Revisions: Multiple rounds included
- Variety: Unlimited variations and settings
- Scalability: Same cost per product, whether you have 1 or 100

The images are indistinguishable from traditional photography in quality, but created using advanced AI tools instead of physical photo shoots.

### How to Get Started

**Step 1: Audit Your Current Images**
Look at your best competitors. What types of images are they using? What's missing from your listings?

**Step 2: Identify Image Gaps**
Do you need:
- Lifestyle context images?
- Detail close-ups?
- Comparison images?
- Feature infographics?

**Step 3: Create Your Image Strategy**
Plan out 7-8 images total:
- 1 main white background
- 3-4 lifestyle context images (different settings)
- 1-2 detail close-ups
- 1-2 comparison or infographic images

**Step 4: Get Professional Images**
Options:
- Traditional photographer ($2,000-5,000, 2-3 weeks)
- AI product photography ($700-1,500, 48-72 hours)
- DIY with professional equipment (requires skills and time)

**Step 5: A/B Test**
Upload new images and monitor your conversion rate. Most sellers see improvement within 7-14 days.

### Conclusion

Professional product photography is one of the highest ROI investments you can make as an Amazon seller. With conversion rate increases of 20-40%, the investment typically pays for itself within 2-4 weeks.

The barrier used to be cost and time. But with AI-powered product photography, you can now get professional images for 70% less cost and 10x faster delivery.

Don't let basic product photos cost you thousands in lost sales. Upgrade your images and watch your conversion rate climb.

## Why Video Marketing Gets 127% More Service Calls (And How to Start)

**Meta Description:** Video marketing drives 127% more customer calls than photos alone. Learn why local service businesses need video ads and how to create them affordably.

**Target Keywords:** video marketing, service business marketing, local business videos, HVAC marketing, contractor marketing

---

### Introduction

If you're a local service business owner—HVAC, roofing, plumbing, landscaping, pool service, auto detailing—you've probably been told you need to "do more marketing."

But here's what most marketing advice misses: **the format matters as much as the frequency.**

Posting photos on Facebook gets some engagement. But posting professional videos? That gets customers calling your phone.

In fact, our recent data shows that service businesses using video marketing get 127% more service calls than those using only photos and text posts.

Let me show you why video works so well and how to start using it—even if you've never created a video before.

### Why Video Works for Service Businesses

**Reason 1: Video Shows Your Process**

Customers hire service businesses based on trust. They need to believe you'll do good work before they let you into their home or business.

Photos show the end result. But video shows:
- How you work
- Your professionalism
- Your equipment and tools
- Your attention to detail
- Your team's expertise

Example: An HVAC company posting a 30-second video of a technician diagnosing and fixing an AC unit builds more trust than 10 static photos.

**Reason 2: Before/After Transformations Are Powerful**

Nothing sells service work like dramatic transformations:
- Green pool to crystal clear blue
- Overgrown yard to perfectly manicured lawn
- Dirty car to showroom shine
- Old damaged roof to beautiful new installation

Video makes these transformations more satisfying and shareable than photos alone.

**Reason 3: Social Media Algorithms Favor Video**

Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube all prioritize video content in their algorithms. This means:
- Videos get 2-3x more organic reach
- Videos are shared more often
- Videos keep viewers on your page longer
- Videos drive more profile visits

Translation: More people see your content without paying for ads.

**Reason 4: Video Drives Action**

According to recent studies:
- 84% of people say watching a video convinced them to purchase
- Videos increase conversion rates by 80%
- Viewers retain 95% of a message when watching video vs. 10% when reading text

For service businesses, this means more phone calls and more booked jobs.

### Real Results: Case Study

**Client:** HVAC company in Phoenix, Arizona
**Before:** Posting photos and text updates on Facebook
**Getting:** 12-15 service calls per month from social media

**Change:** Started posting 2-3 professional service videos per month
**Format:** 30-45 second videos showing:
- Service truck arrival
- Technician diagnosing issue
- Professional repair work
- Happy customer satisfaction

**Results After 90 days:**
- 37 service calls per month from social media (127% increase)
- Videos shared 43 times organically (vs. 3 shares for photos)
- 2,100% increase in Facebook page reach
- Average customer value: $420
- Additional monthly revenue: $10,500

**Investment:** $1,500 for initial 3-video package
**ROI:** Paid back in 6 days

### The 5 Video Types Every Service Business Needs

**1. Before/After Transformation (Most Shareable)**

**Format:** 30-40 seconds
- Show the problem state (5-10 seconds)
- Show your team working (10-15 seconds)
- Show the finished result (10-15 seconds)

**Works best for:** Pool service, landscaping, auto detailing, cleaning, roofing

**Why it works:** Dramatic, satisfying, shows your capability clearly

---

**2. Service Process Showcase**

**Format:** 35-45 seconds
- Arrival with professional vehicle
- Expert diagnosis or assessment
- Quality work being performed
- Customer satisfaction

**Works best for:** HVAC, plumbing, electrical, appliance repair

**Why it works:** Builds trust by showing professionalism and expertise

---

**3. Customer Testimonial**

**Format:** 20-30 seconds
- Happy customer talking about their experience
- Show the completed work while they speak
- Include specific results they achieved

**Works best for:** All service businesses

**Why it works:** Social proof from real customers drives trust

---

**4. Seasonal/Emergency Service**

**Format:** 25-35 seconds
- Address common seasonal issues
- Show your team ready to help
- Call-to-action for booking

**Examples:**
- "AC not working in this heat wave? We're ready to help"
- "Storm damaged your roof? Same-day emergency service"
- "Pool green from winter? Spring opening special"

**Why it works:** Timely, relevant, creates urgency

---

**5. Team Introduction**

**Format:** 40-50 seconds
- Introduce your company
- Show your team and equipment
- Explain what makes you different
- Invite customers to call

**Works best for:** Newer businesses, annual reminders for existing audience

**Why it works:** Humanizes your business, builds local connection

### The Traditional Video Problem

Most service business owners know they should use video. But they don't because:

**Traditional Video Production:**
- Cost: $3,000-10,000 per video
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks from planning to delivery
- Process: Complicated scheduling, permits, crew coordination
- Scalability: Too expensive to create regularly

Result: Most service businesses never start, or they try DIY iPhone videos that look unprofessional.

### The Modern Solution: AI Video Creation

New technology has made professional video production accessible:

**AI Video Production:**
- Cost: $1,500-2,000 for 3 professional videos
- Timeline: 7-10 days from order to delivery
- Process: Simple - you provide info, we create videos
- Scalability: Same cost whether you need 1 or 10

The videos look identical to traditionally filmed content but are created using advanced AI technology.

### How to Get Started with Video Marketing

**Step 1: Choose Your First Video Type**
Start with what's easiest for your business:
- Before/after transformation (if you have good photos)
- Service process showcase
- Seasonal promotion

**Step 2: Plan Your Content**
Decide:
- What service you're highlighting
- What story you're telling
- What call-to-action you want

**Step 3: Create the Video**
Options:
- Hire traditional videographer ($3,000-10,000)
- Use AI video creation ($1,500-2,000 for 3 videos)
- DIY with smartphone (requires editing skills)

**Step 4: Post Strategically**
Where to post:
- Facebook business page
- Instagram feed and reels
- YouTube channel
- Website homepage

When to post:
- Weekdays 8-10 AM or 5-7 PM
- When your audience is most active

**Step 5: Boost Top Performers**
After posting organically, boost videos that perform well:
- $50-100 budget
- Target local area (10-20 mile radius)
- Target homeowners 30-65 years old

### Creating a Video Marketing System

Once you see results, create a system:

**Monthly Video Schedule:**
- Week 1: Before/after transformation
- Week 2: Service process showcase
- Week 3: Customer testimonial
- Week 4: Seasonal or promotional

**Annual Content Calendar:**
- January: New Year special offers
- March: Spring preparation
- June: Summer services
- September: Fall maintenance
- November: Winter prep

### What Makes a Great Service Business Video

**Keep It Short:**
30-45 seconds is perfect. Attention spans are short.

**Start Strong:**
First 3 seconds must grab attention

**Show, Don't Tell:**
Visual demonstration beats talking

**Include Text:**
Many watch without sound - add text overlays

**Clear Call-to-Action:**
Always end with: "Call [number]" or "Visit [website]"

**Professional Quality:**
Lighting, sound, and editing matter

### Common Video Marketing Mistakes

**1. Making Videos Too Long**
Attention drops off after 45 seconds. Keep it tight.

**2. Poor Audio**
Bad audio makes people click away immediately.

**3. No Call-to-Action**
Always tell viewers what to do next.

**4. Inconsistent Posting**
One video won't do much. Consistency builds results.

**5. Only Posting on One Platform**
Repurpose for Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, website.

### Conclusion

Video marketing isn't optional anymore—it's essential. Service businesses using video get 127% more calls, better customer engagement, and higher conversion rates.

The barrier used to be cost and complexity. But with AI video creation, you can now get professional videos for a fraction of traditional costs.

Don't let your competitors dominate social media while you stick with photos. Start video marketing and watch your phone ring more.

## Virtual Staging: Get 403% More Property Inquiries for 95% Less Cost

**Meta Description:** Virtual staging generates 403% more inquiries than empty listings and costs 95% less than physical staging. Learn how it works and why every agent needs it.

**Target Keywords:** virtual staging, real estate staging, vacant property staging, home staging costs

---

### Introduction

Empty rooms don't sell. Every real estate agent knows this. But traditional staging costs $2,000-5,000 per property and requires weeks of coordination with furniture rental companies.

Enter virtual staging: digitally furnished rooms that look photorealistic, cost $300-500 per property, and are delivered in 48-72 hours.

And here's the kicker: virtually staged properties receive 403% more inquiries than empty listings, according to recent data from the National Association of Realtors.

Let me show you how virtual staging works, why it's so effective, and how to use it to sell properties faster and for more money.

### What Is Virtual Staging?

Virtual staging is the process of digitally adding furniture, decor, and finishing touches to empty room photos. Using advanced AI technology, professional designers create photorealistic images showing how a space could look when furnished.

**What you start with:** Empty bedroom with blank walls
**What you get:** Same bedroom with a queen bed, nightstands, lamps, artwork, rug, and styled decor—all looking completely real.

The images are indistinguishable from actual staged photos and can be used in MLS listings, social media, and marketing materials.

### Why Empty Rooms Don't Sell

**Problem 1: Buyers Can't Visualize**
When buyers see empty rooms, they struggle to understand:
- How furniture fits in the space
- What the room dimensions actually are
- How the space functions
- Whether the layout makes sense

Result: They move on to properties that are easier to envision.

**Problem 2: Empty Feels Dated**
Empty rooms often highlight flaws:
- Scuff marks on walls
- Dated flooring
- Weird architectural quirks
- Size issues (too small or awkwardly large)

Furnished rooms draw attention to the potential, not the problems.

**Problem 3: No Emotional Connection**
Real estate is emotional. Buyers need to fall in love. Empty rooms create no emotional response—they're just blank spaces.
Styled, furnished rooms create the "I can see myself living here" moment that leads to offers.

### Virtual Staging vs. Physical Staging

Let's compare the options:

**Physical Staging:**
- Cost: $2,000-5,000 per month
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks to schedule and install
- Flexibility: One style choice, expensive to change
- Duration: Monthly rental, must be removed for showings sometimes
- Logistics: Movers, furniture rental, coordination
- Best for: High-end luxury properties with large budgets

**Virtual Staging:**
- Cost: $300-500 per property (one-time)
- Timeline: 48-72 hours to complete
- Flexibility: Can show multiple styles for same space
- Duration: Images last forever, no removal needed
- Logistics: Simple—send photos, receive styled images
- Best for: All properties, especially vacant or investment properties

### Real Results: The Data

**Study by Real Estate Staging Association:**
- Vacant listings: Average 143 days on market
- Virtually staged listings: Average 73 days on market
- Result: 49% faster sales

**National Association of Realtors Data:**
- Empty listing photos: 100 inquiries
- Virtually staged photos: 503 inquiries
- Result: 403% more interest

**Price Impact:**
- Vacant properties: Sell for 6-10% below asking
- Staged properties: Sell for 1-5% above asking
- On a $400,000 home: $24,000-40,000 difference

### When to Use Virtual Staging

**Mandatory:**
- Vacant properties (nothing to lose, everything to gain)
- Investment properties/flips
- Foreclosures
- Properties that have sat on market 30+ days

**Highly Recommended:**
- Outdated or awkwardly furnished properties
- Properties with odd layouts
- Luxury listings (show potential for each room)
- New construction (help buyers visualize before completion)

**Optional but Valuable:**
- Well-furnished properties (virtually declutter or update)
- Showing different style options for buyer preferences

### How Virtual Staging Works

**Step 1: Professional Photos**
Photographer takes high-quality photos of empty rooms. Standard real estate photography—no special equipment needed.

**Step 2: Select Rooms to Stage**
Typical package stages 6-10 rooms:
- Living room
- Kitchen/dining
- Master bedroom
- 2-3 additional bedrooms
- Home office or bonus room

**Step 3: Choose Styles**
Select from styles:
- Modern contemporary
- Traditional classic
- Transitional
- Farmhouse/rustic
- Minimalist
- Luxury/upscale

Or get multiple style options for the same room to appeal to different buyer preferences.

**Step 4: Review and Deliver**
Receive staged images in 48-72 hours, review, request any revisions, then use in all marketing.

### Best Practices for Virtual Staging

**Do:**
- ✅ Disclose that images are virtually staged (legally required)
- ✅ Stage the most important rooms (living, master, kitchen)
- ✅ Choose styles appropriate to the home and market
- ✅ Ensure furniture scale matches room size
- ✅ Use consistent style throughout property

**Don't:**
- ❌ Virtually stage without disclosure (legal issues)
- ❌ Over-stage to the point of looking fake
- ❌ Stage rooms that don't match the home's price point
- ❌ Use dramatically different styles in each room
- ❌ Forget to stage outdoor spaces if applicable

### Legal Requirements

All major real estate organizations require disclosure:

**MLS Listings:** Mark photos as "virtually staged"
**Social Media:** Include disclosure in posts
**Marketing Materials:** Note "images virtually staged" on flyers
Most states require this disclosure by law. Always consult your broker on specific requirements.

### ROI Calculation

**Example Property:** $450,000 listing

**Physical Staging:**
- Cost: $3,500 for 2 months
- Result: Sells in 60 days at $445,000 (below asking)
- Total cost with holding: $3,500 staging + $6,000 mortgage/utilities
- Net loss: $14,500

**Virtual Staging:**
- Cost: $400 one-time
- Result: Sells in 45 days at $455,000 (above asking)
- Total cost with holding: $400 staging + $4,500 mortgage/utilities
- Net gain: $200

**Difference:** $14,700 better outcome with virtual staging

### Common Objections Answered

**"Won't buyers be disappointed when they visit?"**
No—because they already know the home is vacant (listing says so). Virtual staging helps them visualize potential. When they visit, they can picture what you showed them.

**"Isn't it dishonest?"**
Not when disclosed properly. You're helping buyers see possibility, not hiding anything.

**"What if they want different furniture?"**
Perfect—they'll furnish it their way. You're just showing one possibility.

**"My property photographs well empty."**
The data disagrees. Even beautiful empty rooms get 403% fewer inquiries than staged ones.

### Conclusion

Virtual staging is no longer experimental—it's standard practice for high-performing agents. With 403% more inquiries, 49% faster sales, and 95% cost savings compared to physical staging, the ROI is undeniable.

Every vacant property should be virtually staged. Period.

## AI vs. Traditional Product Photography: Which Is Right for Your Business?

**Meta Description:** Compare AI product photography vs. traditional photo shoots. Learn costs, timelines, quality differences, and which is right for your e-commerce business.

**Target Keywords:** AI product photography, product photo shoot, e-commerce photography, product images cost

---

### Introduction

In the world of e-commerce, product photography is everything. It's the only way customers can interact with your product before buying. Traditionally, getting high-quality images meant shipping products to a studio, paying thousands of dollars, and waiting weeks.

But now, AI product photography is disrupting the industry. It promises studio-quality images at a fraction of the cost and speed. Is it too good to be true? Which option is truly right for your business?

In this guide, we'll compare AI photography and traditional photography head-to-head on cost, quality, speed, and scalability, so you can make the best decision for your brand.

### The Cost Comparison

**Traditional Photography:**
- **Studio Fee:** $500 - $2,000 per day
- **Per Image Cost:** $30 - $100+ per edited image
- **Shipping:** Cost to ship products to/from studio
- **Props/Models:** Extra fees for specific settings or live models
- **Total Typical Cost:** $2,500+ for a standard catalog shoot (30-50 images)

**AI Product Photography:**
- **Setup Fee:** Generally lower or included
- **Per Image Cost:** $10 - $30 per image
- **Shipping:** Only digital assets needed (or reference photos)
- **Props/Models:** Included in capability (AI generated)
- **Total Typical Cost:** $500 - $1,000 for the same 30-50 images

**Winner:** AI Photography (50-80% savings)

### Speed and Turnaround

**Traditional Photography:**
- **Booking:** Can take weeks to find a slot
- **Shipping:** 3-5 days for products to arrive
- **Shooting:** 1-2 days
- **Editing:** 5-10 days
- **Total Time:** 2-4 weeks

**AI Product Photography:**
- **Process:** Upload reference images
- **Generation:** 24-48 hours
- **Refinement:** 24 hours
- **Total Time:** 2-3 days

**Winner:** AI Photography (10x faster)

### Quality and Realism

**Traditional Photography:**
- **Pros:** Authentic 100% reality. Best for complex textures or highly reflective surfaces where light physics are critical.
- **Cons:** Dependent on photographer skill, equipment, and studio limitations.

**AI Product Photography:**
- **Pros:** Perfect lighting every time, infinite background possibilities, consistent angles.
- **Cons:** Can sometimes struggle with very complex transparent materials or extremely specific mechanical details (though rapidly improving).

**Winner:** Tie (depends on product type). For 90% of consumer goods, quality is indistinguishable.

### Scalability and Flexibility

**Traditional Photography:**
- **Re-shoots:** Expensive and time-consuming. If you want a different background, you have to reshoot.
- **Volume:** Hard to scale up quickly without hiring more photographers.

**AI Product Photography:**
- **Re-shoots:** Instant. Change the background from a beach to a mountain in clicks.
- **Volume:** Infinite scalability. Generate 100 or 1,000 variations with the same effort.

**Winner:** AI Photography (Hands down)

### Which Is Right For You?

**Choose Traditional Photography If:**
- You sell extremely high-end luxury items where "authenticity" is a brand pillar.
- Your products have very complex optical properties (e.g., certain types of jewelry or cut glass) that AI still finds tricky.
- You require a specific celebrity or unique physical location that cannot be replicated.

**Choose AI Product Photography If:**
- You are an Amazon/Shopify seller needing high-converting images quickly.
- You need lifestyle images in various settings (kitchen, outdoors, office) without renting locations.
- You have a limited budget but want professional-grade look.
- You need to test different marketing angles fast (A/B testing backgrounds).
- You have a large catalog and need consistency across thousands of SKUs.

### Conclusion

For the vast majority of e-commerce businesses, AI product photography offers a superior balance of cost, speed, and quality. It democratizes access to high-end imagery that was previously reserved for big brands with big budgets.

While traditional photography still has its niche in ultra-luxury or highly specific technical fields, AI is rapidly becoming the new standard for efficient, high-converting e-commerce visuals.

## The Complete Guide to Social Media Content Creation for Local Businesses

**Meta Description:** Learn how to create consistent social media content for your local business without spending 20 hours per week. Practical strategies that actually work.

**Target Keywords:** social media content, local business marketing, social media strategy, business social media

---

### Introduction

Running a local business is hard enough without having to be a full-time content creator too. We get it. You know you *should* be posting on social media, but finding the time and ideas is a constant struggle.

The result? Weeks of silence, followed by a random burst of posts, then silence again. This inconsistency kills your reach and engagement.

But what if you could have a month's worth of professional content done in just a few hours?

In this guide, we'll break down a practical, sustainable content strategy specifically for local business owners—not influencers.

### The "Content Pillars" Strategy

Don't just post randomly. Pick 3-5 key themes ("pillars") that represent your brand. This makes brainstorming easy.

**Example Pillars for a Local Gym:**
1.  **Education:** Workout tips, nutrition advice
2.  **Community:** Member spotlights, local events
3.  **Behind the Scenes:** Staff introductions, cleaning routine
4.  **Promotional:** Special offers, new classes
5.  **Motivation:** Quotes, progress photos

Rotate through these. If you post 3 times a week, you just need 12 posts a month. That's approx 2-3 of each type.

### Batching: The Secret Weapon

Never create content "day of." It's stressful and inefficient. Instead, batch it.

**The Monthly Batch Routine:**
1.  **Brainstorm (30 mins):** Sit down with your calendar. Note holidays, local events, or business promos. Fill in the slots with your pillars.
2.  **Capture (2 hours):** Dedicate one afternoon to shooting photos/videos. Walk around your business. Get 5 photos of staff, 5 of products, 5 of happy customers (with permission), 5 detail shots. You now have your visual library.
3.  **Create (2 hours):** Use Canva or similar tools to add text, logos, or captions. Write your captions all at once.
4.  **Schedule (30 mins):** Use Meta Business Suite (free) or tools like Buffer/Later to schedule everything for the month.

**Total Time:** ~5 hours once a month.

### What to Post: High-Engagement Ideas

Stuck for ideas? Here are formats that always work for local businesses:

**1. "Meet the Team"**
People buy from people. A simple photo of a staff member + 3 fun facts about them gets great engagement.

**2. "How It's Made / Done"**
Time-lapse of your process. A florist arranging a bouquet, a mechanic fixing a brake, a baker icing a cake. People love watching skilled work.

**3. Customer User-Generated Content (UGC)**
Repost photos your customers take at your business (with credit). It's social proof + free content.

**4. Local Spotlights**
Shout out other non-competing local businesses. "Great coffee at [Neighbor Cafe] this morning!" It builds community goodwill and cross-promotion.

**5. QA / FAQs**
Answer common questions. "We often get asked how to..." It establishes authority.

### Visuals Matter: Quality Over Quantity

You don't need a professional camera (mostly), but your phone photos should be decent.

- **Lighting:** Always prioritize natural light. Face windows, don't have them behind you.
- **Clean Lens:** Wipe your phone camera lens! This is the #1 cause of blurry photos.
- **Stability:** Use a cheap tripod or prop your phone up for videos.
- **Editing:** One tap of "Auto" edit often helps, or use a consistent filter (like VSCO A6) for branding.

**When to hire a pro:** For your website "Hero" images, main profile pictures, or specific ad campaigns. For daily social, phone is fine.

### Tools to Make Life Easier

- **Canva:** For designing graphics/flyers.
- **CapCut:** For editing Reels/TikToks easily.
- **ChatGPT:** Great for generating caption ideas or rewriting text to be punchier.
- **Meta Business Suite:** Schedule posts for FB and Insta for free.

### Conclusion

Social media for local business isn't about going viral. It's about staying top-of-mind for your local community so when they need your service, they think of you first.

By using content pillars and batching your work, you can turn a daily headache into a manageable monthly task.

## How AI Is Changing Marketing (And What It Means for Small Businesses)

**Meta Description:** AI tools are revolutionizing marketing. Discover how small businesses can leverage AI for photography, video, content, and more—without massive budgets.

**Target Keywords:** AI marketing, AI for small business, AI tools business, marketing automation

### Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) isn't just for tech giants anymore. It's rapidly becoming the great equalizer for small businesses. Tools that used to cost thousands per month or require a team of specialists are now accessible for the price of a Netflix subscription.

For small business owners, this is a game-changer. It means you can compete with big brands on content quality, personalization, and speed—if you know how to use the tools.

Here’s a breakdown of how AI is reshaping marketing landscapes and practical ways you can leverage it today.

### 1. Visual Content Creation (Images & Video)

**The Old Way:** Hiring photographers, models, renting studios, editing for days.
**The AI Way:** Generators like Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or specialized product photography AI.

**Impact:** You can generate high-quality, custom imagery for ads, social posts, and blogs in seconds. Whether it's a "photorealistic image of a happy family using your product" or "futuristic concept art," ability is limited only by imagination.

**Action:** Use AI tools to create lifestyle backgrounds for your product photos (like we discussed in previous posts!).

### 2. Copywriting and Content Strategy

**The Old Way:** Staring at a blank page, hiring expensive copywriters, struggling with SEO.
**The AI Way:** ChatGPT, Claude, Jasper.

**Impact:** AI can draft blog posts (like this one!), write catchy social captions, generate email subject lines, suggesting ad hook variations, and even plan entire content calendars based on your industry trends.

**Action:** Don't just ask "Write a post." Give it context: "Act as a marketing expert for a local bakery. Write 5 Instagram captions about our new sourdough bread, focusing on the fermentation process and health benefits. Tone: warm, inviting."

### 3. Personalization at Scale

**The Old Way:** One generic email blast to everyone.
**The AI Way:** Dynamic segmentation and personalized recommendations.

**Impact:** AI analyzes customer behavior to predict what they want next. It can send specific emails based on browsing history ("Hey, saw you looked at these sneakers...") without you lifting a finger.

**Action:** exploring email marketing platforms (like Mailchimp or Klaviyo) that have built-in AI optimization features.

### 4. Customer Service (Chatbots 2.0)

**The Old Way:** "Please hold while we connect you..." or waiting 24 hours for an email reply.
**The AI Way:** Intelligent chatbots that understand context and resolve issues instantly.

**Impact:** Modern AI agents can handle bookings, answer FAQs, track orders, and even recommend products conversationally, 24/7. This improves customer satisfaction and frees up your time.

**Action:** Look into AI customer support tools that integrate with your website.

### 5. Data Analysis & Insights

**The Old Way:** Spreadsheets, confusion, and "gut feeling."
**The AI Way:** "Hey AI, look at this sales data and tell me which marketing channel had the best ROI last month."

**Impact:** AI excels at pattern recognition. It can spot trends you might miss, such as "Sales dip every Tuesday, maybe run a promo then?" or "Customers who buy X often buy Y two weeks later."

### The "Human Touch" is Still Key

**Warning:** Don't automate everything. People crave connection.
- **Use AI** for the draft, the structure, the data, and the visuals.
- **Use Humans** for the final polish, the strategy, the empathy, and the brand voice.

AI is a co-pilot, not the captain.

### Conclusion

The businesses that will thrive in the next 5 years aren't necessarily the ones with the biggest budgets, but the ones that adapt to these new tools fastest. AI allows a solopreneur to output the work of a 5-person marketing team.

Start small. Pick one area—maybe blog writing or product photos—and experiment with AI tools. You'll be amazed at the efficiency gains.

### Comparison: Before vs. After

**The Client:** "EcoHome Essentials" (name changed for privacy), selling reusable bamboo kitchen organizers.
**The Problem:** Great product, decent reviews (4.5 stars), but stagnant sales. Stuck at ~$2,000/month revenue. ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales) was high at 45%.
**The Diagnosis:** Listing images were mediocre. Just 3 photos: one main white background (poorly lit), one picture of the box, and one blurry photo of it on a counter. Competitors had sleek, lifestyle-rich imagery.

### The Intervention: Visual Overhaul

We didn't change the product, the price, or the PPC keywords. We *only* changed the images.

**The New Image Stack:**
1.  **Main Image:** Crisp, high-contrast, perfectly white background, slight shadow for depth.
2.  **Infographic 1 (Dimensions):** Clearly showing size/capacity (addressing a common customer question).
3.  **Infographic 2 (Benefits):** "Eco-Friendly," "Water Resistant," "Easy Clean" icons.
4.  **Lifestyle 1 (Context):** Beautifully staged modern kitchen drawer, perfectly organized with the product.
5.  **Lifestyle 2 (In Use):** Hands placing silverware into the organizer (human element).
6.  **Comparison Chart:** "Us vs. Them" (Plastic vs. Bamboo).
7.  **Giftable Shot:** Product in nice packaging with a bow (targeting gift buyers).

**Cost:** ~$850 for the complete AI-enhanced photography package.

### The Timeline

-   **Week 0:** New images uploaded.
-   **Week 1:** Conversion rate bumped from 5% to 8%. Sales trickled up.
-   **Week 2:** PPC campaigns re-optimized. Because conversion rate was higher, Amazon started showing the ad more often. ACOS dropped to 32%.
-   **Week 4:** Organic ranking improved. Moved from Page 2 to Page 1 for main keyword "bamboo drawer organizer."
-   **Month 3:** Revenue hit $12,400.

### The Results by Numbers

| Metric | Before | After (90 Days) | Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conversion Rate** | 5.2% | 14.8% | **+184%** |
| **Sessions (Traffic)** | 1,500 | 3,800 | **+153%** |
| **ACOS (Ad Cost)** | 45% | 24% | **-21% (Better)** |
| **Monthly Revenue** | $2,150 | $12,400 | **5.7x Increase** |

### Why It Worked

1.  **Trust:** Professional images signal a professional brand. The previous photos looked like a garage sale find; the new ones looked like Crate & Barrel.
2.  **Answered Questions Visually:** The dimension infographic stopped people from clicking away to find size info.
3.  **Emotional Connection:** The lifestyle shots made people feel "If I buy this, my kitchen will look this organized and peaceful."

### Takeaway for Sellers

You can have the best product in the world, but on Amazon, customers buy the *image* of the product first. If your conversion rate is low, stop tweaking your PPC bids and look at your photos.

An investment of <$1,000 unlocked $10k/month in recurring revenue. That's an ROI that beats almost any other optimization you can make.

## How to Create a Month's Worth of Social Media Content in One Day

**Meta Description:** Step-by-step guide to batch-creating 30 days of social media content in one 4-hour session. Includes templates and posting schedule.

**Target Keywords:** batch create social media content, social media planning, content calendar, social media templates

---

### Introduction

"I don't have time for social media." It's the #1 excuse business owners give. And if you're trying to post every single day in real-time, you're right—you don't. That's a full-time job.

The pros don't do that. The pros **batch**.

Batching is grouping similar tasks together to maximize focus and efficiency. Instead of switching your brain into "creative mode" 30 times a month, you do it once.

Here is the exact 4-hour protocol to create 30 days of content in one sitting.

### The Setup (Pre-Work)
Tools needed:
- Google Sheets / Excel (Calendar)
- Canva (Design)
- Phone/Camera
- Scheduling Tool (Meta Business Suite, Buffer, etc.)

### Hour 1: Strategy & Calendar

Don't open Canva yet. Open your spreadsheet.
**Goal:** Fill 30 slots with *ideas*.

1.  **Map Key Dates:** Holidays? Sales? Events?
2.  **Apply Pillars:** (See our previous post). Rotate your themes.
    - Mon: Motivation/Education
    - Wed: Product/Service Spotlight
    - Fri: Behind the Scenes/Fun
    - Sun: Customer Review
3.  **Write Hooks:** For each slot, write just the concept. "Photo of coffee machine -> Caption about morning routine -> Ask followers their order."

*Result: A plan. No more "what do I post?" anxiety.*

### Hour 2: Asset Collection (Shooting)

Get up from the desk.
**Goal:** Get raw photos/videos.

1.  **The "B-Roll" Walk:** Walk around your office/store/home. Take 15 second videos of *everything*. Typing, pouring coffee, the view out the window, packing an order, organizing shelves.
2.  **Product Shots:** Set up one nice spot with good light. Shoot 10 products/items.
3.  **Selfie/Team Time:** Get 5 photos of faces. Smile, point at blank space (for text later), thinking face, etc.

*Tip: Change your shirt halfway through so it doesn't look like it was all same day!*

### Hour 3: Creation & Editing

Sit back down. Open Canva.
**Goal:** Make the posts.

1.  **Templates are King:** Don't start from scratch. Create 3-4 "Master Templates" for quotes, testimonials, and announcements.
2.  **Plug & Play:** Drop your new photos into the templates.
3.  **Reels/TikToks:** Use the "B-Roll" footage. Add trending audio. Add text overlay. Keep it simple.
4.  **Write Captions:** Go back to your spreadsheet plan. Write the captions in batch. Use AI to speed this up.

### Hour 4: Scheduling

**Goal:** Set it and forget it.

1.  Upload everything to your scheduler.
2.  Copy/paste captions.
3.  Add hashtags (keeps a saved list of hashtag groups).
4.  Hit "Schedule."

### The "One Day" Schedule Template

- **9:00 - 10:00:** Coffee + Strategy/Calendar
- **10:00 - 11:00:** Shooting Photos/Video
- **11:00 - 11:15:** Break
- **11:15 - 12:15:** Canva / Editing
- **12:15 - 1:00:** Scheduling

### Why This Works
Cognitive switching costs are real. It takes ~20 mins to get into "flow." By batching, you enter flow state once and stay there. You ensure consistent branding. You ensure you never miss a day because "you got busy."

**Challenge:** Mark one Saturday or Sunday this month as "Content Day." Try this protocol. You'll feel incredibly relieved knowing your marketing is handled for the next 4 weeks.

### Introduction

The HVAC industry is competitive. In any medium-sized city, there are dozens of contractors fighting for the same broken AC units and furnace tune-ups.

Word of mouth is great, but it's not scalable. To grow, you need a marketing machine that brings in leads predictably.

What works in 2025 isn't what worked in 2015. Yellow Pages are dead. SEO is harder. Social media is essential. Here is the modern playbook for HVAC growth.

### 1. Google Business Profile (The Foundation)

If you do nothing else, dominate this. When someone's AC breaks, they search "AC repair near me." The "Map Pack" (the 3 listings at the top) gets 70% of the clicks.

**How to rank:**
- **Reviews:** You need volume and recentness. Automate review requests after every job.
- **Photos:** Upload photos of your team, trucks, and completed jobs weekly. Google loves active profiles.
- **Completeness:** Fill out every field. Services, hours, service area.

### 2. Local Service Ads (LSA)

These are the "Google Guaranteed" ads *above* the map pack.
- **Pay Per Lead:** You only pay when someone calls you, not just clicks.
- **Trust:** The Google Guarantee badge builds massive trust.
- **Voice Search:** These power "Hey Google, find me a plumber" results.

### 3. Website: Conversion Over Flash

Your website doesn't need to win design awards. It needs to convert traffic into calls.
**Must-haves:**
- **"Sticky" Call Button:** A "Call Now" button that stays at the bottom of the screen on mobile.
- **Real Photos:** No stock photos of smiling models in blue shirts. Use YOUR team.
- **Online Booking:** 40% of bookings happen after hours. If they can't book online, they'll call the next guy who picks up or has a scheduler.

### 4. Video Ads on Facebook/Instagram

Target homeowners in your service area with video.
**The "Problem/Agitation/Solution" Ad:**
- *Visual:* Sweaty person fanning themselves inside.
- *Hook:* "AC struggling on these 100-degree days? Don't sweat it."
- *Offer:* "$59 Tune-Up Special for [City] Homeowners."
- *CTA:* Book Now.

Retargeting: Show these ads to anyone who visited your website but didn't call.

### 5. Email/SMS Keep-in-Touch

The money is in the maintenance plans.
- **Spring:** "Is your AC ready for summer? Book your tune-up."
- **Fall:** "Furnace safety check time."
- **Storm Alerts:** "Big freeze coming. Here is how to protect your pipes."

Stay top of mind so when something breaks, they don't search Google—they search their contacts for YOU.

### Conclusion

Stop buying shared leads from HomeAdvisor/Angi where you fight 5 other guys for the lowest price. Build your own assets. Own your Google Profile, your website, your audience.

It takes time to build, but once this engine is running, you'll have more work than you can handle.

**Target Keywords:** product photography trends, e-commerce trends, photography 2025, product image trends

---

### Introduction

E-commerce moves fast. What looked "professional" 3 years ago looks "dated" today. Remember pure white backgrounds for *everything*? Boring.

In 2025, customers want experience, texture, and authenticity. They want to *feel* the product through the screen. Here are the 7 visual trends driving sales right now.

### 1. "Messy" Lifestyle (The Anti-Studio Look)

Gone are the sterile, perfect rooms. In is the "lived-in" aesthetic.
- Crumpled sheets for bedding.
- Spilled ingredients for food products.
- A phone casually left on the table.
**Why:** It feels authentic. It looks like UGC (User Generated Content), which customers trust more than ads.

### 2. Hard Flash / Pop Art

High contrast, hard shadows, saturated colors. Think 90s flash photography or nostalgic indie magazines.
- **Best for:** Gen Z brands, cosmetics, beverages, streetwear.
- **Vibe:** Edgy, high-energy, confident.

### 3. Floating/Levitation Elements

Products suspended in mid-air, often with ingredients or components floating around them.
- **Best for:** Tech gadgets (exploded views), skincare (ingredients), drinks.
- **Why:** Dynamic and eye-catching. Stops the scroll.

### 4. AI-Augmented Surrealism

Using AI to create backgrounds that would be impossible/expensive to build.
- A sneaker on Mars.
- A watch melting like a Dali painting.
- **Trend:** Blending real product photos with fantastical AI environments.

### 5. Textural Macro Shots

Extreme close-ups where you can feel the texture.
- The grain of the leather.
- The bubbles in the soda.
- The weave of the fabric.
**Why:** Overcomes the "tactile gap" of online shopping. It proves quality.

### 6. Video Snippets (GIFs/MP4s) in Carousels

Static listings are dead. The 2nd or 3rd image in a gallery is now a moving image.
- A 3-second loop of the fabric moving.
- Light glinting off the jewelry.
- Steam rising from the coffee.

### 7. Monochrome Styling

Product and background describe the same color.
- Pink bag on pink background with pink props.
- **Why:** visually soothing and very high-end fashion. Makes the design details pop without color distraction.

### Conclusion

Don't settle for boring. Your product images are your 24/7 sales associates. Dress them up in the latest styles. Experiment with one of these trends for your next product launch and watch engagement soar.

**Target Keywords:** product photography cost, hire product photographer, photography decision, in-house vs outsource

---

### Introduction

As your e-commerce business scales, you hit a bottleneck: **Content.** You need more images, faster, for ads, socials, and new SKUs.

At this crossroad, you have three paths:
1.  **Build In-House:** Buy geat, hire a photographer.
2.  **Outsource:** Hire an agency or freelancer.
3.  **Automate:** Use AI technology.

Which is the smart play? Let's break down the ROI.

### Option 1: In-House Studio

**The Setup:** You rent space, buy cameras/lights ($5k+), and hire a full-time shooter ($50k-$80k/yr).
- **Pros:** Total control. Instant access. Brand consistency.
- **Cons:** High fixed overhead. Managing creative staff. Equipment depreciation.
- **Verdict:** Only viable if you are shooting daily (e.g., fast fashion brand launching 50+ items a week). Otherwise, it's a money pit.

### Option 2: Outsourcing (Agency/Freelancer)

**The Setup:** Ship products to a pro. Pay per project.
- **Pros:** Professional quality. No equipment management. expert lighting.
- **Cons:** Slower turnaround (shipping + editing time). High variable cost ($30-$100 per image). Communication friction ("That's not the angle I wanted...").
- **Verdict:** Best for "Hero" images, complex products, or flagship launches where perfection is mandatory.

### Option 3: AI Photography

**The Setup:** Take simple photos, use AI to generate pro backgrounds/lighting.
- **Pros:** Lowest cost. Fastest speed. Infinite scalability. No shipping.
- **Cons:** Learning curve for tools. Sometimes lacks "soul" of a human shoot.
- **Verdict:** The winner for "Volume" need. Catalog photos, social media daily posts, A/B testing ads.

### The Hybrid Model (The Sweet Spot)

The smartest brands do this:
1.  **Hire Freelancer** for the "Hero" homepage banner and definitive packaging shots. (20% of content).
2.  **Use AI** for social media content, product variations, and ad testing. (80% of content).

This optimizes budget: Spend big on the few images that define the brand, spend efficient on the high-volume feed content.

### Decision Matrix

-   **Budget < $500/mo?** -> DIY + AI Tools.
-   **Budget $2k/mo?** -> Hybrid (Freelancer quarterly + AI daily).
-   **Budget $10k/mo?** -> Retainer Agency or Part-time In-house.

**Meta Description:** Prepare your e-commerce store for holiday shopping season. Product photography checklist, festive styling ideas, and timeline for Q4 success.

**Target Keywords:** holiday product photography, Q4 e-commerce, holiday shopping prep, seasonal photography

---

### Introduction

Q4 (October-December) can make or break your year. 40-50% of annual revenue often happens here.

You optimize your inventory and ads, but do you optimize your *visuals*?
Shoppers are in "Gift Mode." Your images need to scream "I am the perfect gift." A plain white background doesn't say that. A cozy, festive scene does.

### The Q4 Photography Checklist

**1. The "Gift-Ready" Shot**
Show your product wrapped. Show it coming out of a stocking. Show it in a gift box.
*Psychology:* You assure the buyer "this will look good when I give it."

**2. The Festive Context**
- **Subtle:** Warm lighting, pinecones, wood textures, red/gold accents.
- **Overt:** Christmas trees, menorahs, snow, ornaments.
*Tip:* Make sure the "Overt" ones are used only during the season, or it looks lazy in January.

**3. Bundles & Sets**
You'll sell more bundles in Q4. Photograph your products *together*. " The Ultimate Starter Kit."
*Data:* Bundles increase AOV (Average Order Value).

### Timeline for Success

-   **September:** Plan concepts. Book photographers or start AI generation.
-   **October 1st:** Update website banners to Fall/Pre-Holiday themes.
-   **November 1st:** Full Holiday switch. All social posts and ad creatives are festive.
-   **December 26th:** The "New Year, New You" switch. (Pivot from gifting to self-improvement).

### Styling Ideas on a Budget

Don't have a holiday studio?
- **AI Gen:** "Product X on a rustic wooden table with soft Christmas lights in background, bokeh."
- **Props:** Go to hobby lobby. Buy ribbon, fake snow, pine branches. Simple props go a long way.

**Don't wait until Black Friday.** By then, it's too late. Start your visual prep now.

**Target Keywords:** [City] marketing, local business, advertising, small business

---

### Introduction

If you run a bakery, gym, clinic, or shop, you aren't competing with Amazon. You're competing with the guy down the street. The game is **Proximity** and **Trust**.

Here is how to win the "Near Me" game in 2025.

### 1. Hyper-Local SEO

Don't just rank for "Coffee Shop." Rank for "Coffee shop in [Neighborhood Name]."
- **Website:** Create location pages if you serve multiple areas.
- **Content:** Blog about local events. Sponsor a local little league team and put it on your site. Google mimics real-world relevance.

### 2. The "Face" Strategy

Big chains are faceless. You are not. Use that.
- **Socials:** The owner should be in the videos. Talk to the camera.
- **Story:** Why did you open this business in this town? People support neighbors.

### 3. Community Collabs

The 1+1=3 effect.
- **Gym + Juice Bar:** Discount for each other's members.
- **Realtor + Moving Company:** Referral package.
- **Bridal Shop + Florist:** Styled shoot.
Cross-pollinate your audiences. It's free and highly targeted.

### 4. SMS Marketing (Text Messages)

Email open rates: 20%. SMS open rates: 98%.
- **Use sparingly:** "Flash sale: Leftover donuts 50% off for next hour."
- **Loyalty:** "Happy Birthday [Name]! Come in for a free treat."
Local customers appreciate relevant, timely pings.

### Conclusion

You have an advantage big brands don't: You can shake hands. You can sponsor the school play. You can know orders by heart.
Combine that "Small Town Charm" with "Big City Digital Tools" (SEO, SMS, Video), and you become unstoppable.

*(Condensed for brevity - covering top FAQs)*

### 1. What exactly is AI Product Photography?
It is using artificial intelligence software to generate backgrounds, lighting, and environments around a static image of your product, rather than physically photographing it in a location.

### 2. Does it look fake?
Early versions did. Modern tools (Midjourney v6, specialized e-comm AI) are nearly indistinguishable from reality when used correctly. Lighting matching is the key.

### 3. Is it legal?
Yes. You own the specific generations you create in most platforms.

### 4. Do I need to send my product anywhere?
No! That's the best part. You just upload a decent phone photo of your product, and the AI builds around it.

### 5. Can it handle complex products?
It struggles with: Transparent glass (refraction), text on labels (getting better but tricky), and mirrors. It excels with: Solid objects, packaging, clothes, furniture.

### 6. Is it expensive?
Compared to a photoshoot? No. Subscriptions range from $30-$100/month. A single photoshoot is $2k+.

### 7. Can I use it for Amazon?
Yes, absolutely. Amazon cares about white backgrounds (main image) and relevance (lifestyle). AI provides both.

### Introduction

You have a product. You have a Shopify account. Now you need photos.
Bad photos = No trust = No sales.
It's that simple. You cannot "copywrite" your way out of bad visuals.

Here is the starter pack for a new store owner.

### The "Shot List": What You Need
Don't just take one pic. You need a mix:
1.  **The "Hero":** White background, front and center. (For collection pages).
2.  **The "Angle":** Side/Back view. show details.
3.  **The "Scale":** Show it next to a hand, a coin, or a human to show size.
4.  **The "Vibe" (Lifestyle):** Show it being used. This sells the *dream*.
5.  **The "Proof":** Packaging or ingredients close-up.

### DIY vs. Pro: The Budget Reality

**Budget: $0 - $100**
- Use your iPhone (Portrait mode).
- Buy a white poster board ($5) for a background.
- Shoot near a window (Natural light is free).
- Edit in Lightroom Mobile (Free).

**Budget: $100 - $500**
- Buy a "Lightbox" from Amazon ($40).
- Use AI tools to generate lifestyle backgrounds for your phone shots.

**Budget: $500+**
- Ship to a pro or hire a local student photographer.

### Common Rookie Mistakes
1.  **Mixing Aspect Ratios:** Don't have some square, some tall, some wide. It messes up your site layout. Stick to Square (1:1) or Portrait (4:5).
2.  **Inconsistent Backgrounds:** If using grey, use the *same* grey code for all products.
3.  **Too Small:** Images should be at least 1500px wide so customers can zoom in.

### Conclusion
Start simple. Consistency is better than perfection. You can always upgrade your photos later, but launch with clean, bright, consistent images.
